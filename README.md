## Features

### Run Claude agents the right way

Run agents locally, in worktrees, in background — without touching main branch.

- **Git Worktree Isolation** - Each chat session runs in its own isolated worktree
- **Background Execution** - Run agents in background while you continue working
- **Local-first** - All code stays on your machine, no cloud sync required
- **Branch Safety** - Never accidentally commit to main branch

- **Clarifying Questions** - Claude asks what it needs to know before starting

## Installation

### Option 1: Build from source (free)

```bash
# Prerequisites: Bun, Python, Xcode Command Line Tools (macOS)
bun install
bun run claude:download  # Download Claude binary (required!)
bun run build
bun run package:mac  # or package:win, package:linux
```

> **Important:** The `claude:download` step downloads the Claude CLI binary which is required for the agent chat to work. If you skip this step, the app will build but agent functionality won't work.
